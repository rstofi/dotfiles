## tmux setup

I am just starting out with `tmux`, so pretty basic configuration for now.


### Custom key bindings

I have changed some of my key bindings, so my own cheat sheet:

<Leader>: `Ctrl` `space` (instead of `Ctrl` `b`)

Horizontal split: `Ctrl` `-`(instead of `Ctrl` `"`)
Vertical split: `Ctrl` `|` (instead of `Ctrl` `%`)

**Vim motions for moving between Panes**

`Ctrl` `h` (left)
`Ctrl` `l` (right)
`Ctrl` `j` (down)
`Ctrl` `k` (up)
