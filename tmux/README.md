## tmux setup

I am just starting out with `tmux`, so pretty basic configuration for now.

To enable mouse copy support, I need to install the `xclip` package.

### Custom key bindings

I have changed some of my key bindings, so my own cheat sheet:

<Leader>: `Ctrl` `space` (instead of `Ctrl` `b`)

- Horizontal split: `Ctrl` `space` `-`(instead of `Ctrl` `b` `"`)
- Vertical split: `Ctrl` `space` `|` (instead of `Ctrl` `b` `%`)
- New pane: `Ctrl` `space` `c`

**Vim motions for moving between Panes**

- `Ctrl` `h` (left)
- `Ctrl` `l` (right)
- `Ctrl` `j` (down)
- `Ctrl` `k` (up)
