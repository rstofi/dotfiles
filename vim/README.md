## vim setup

I am using `vim`, and currently, I am *not* planingn to update to `neovim` as I am happy with my setup.

### Custom key bindings

I have set my `<leader>` character to `space`.

(Note that my `tmux` `<leader>` is set to `C`+`space`!)

### Plugs

I try to minimize plugs and only have the ones I am actually using.

To manage my plugs, I use the [vim plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) plugin manager. See the documentation for the installation instructions.

The list of my plugs and what I am using them for:

- [jedi-vim](https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi-vim) for python auto completion support

### Useful plug command cheat sheet

**General**

`space` `y` - yank to system clipboard
`space` `p` - paste from system clipboard

**Pyton**

`Tab` - autocomplete python code and variables
`space` `r` - rename variable

### Color scheme setup

Similary to my terminal, I use the gruvbox color scheme.
