# My dotfiles

Once again, I am attempting to move my workflow to the terminal as much as I can. Therefore, I need to set up various TUI-based software that runs in the terminal. Since I am working on different machines and on different systems, I attempt to define and collect all my dotfiles to have a reproducible work environment.

Some dotfiles (such as `.bashrc`) are living in my home and some are under `/.config`, some has more complex location setup. Therefore in this repository I separate my dot files for each software I use.
